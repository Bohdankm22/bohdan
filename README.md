- I was always interested about the world of finance. Researching, "playing" on sandbox brokerage accounts etc. However, in the Ukraine investing is not common even between office workers and you don't often here them discussing stock prices of one or another company (exception is only the company they work for or partnered). In Ukraine most of the people see the world of investing as some king of casino where you have to gamble to "win" anything. So with that said people prefer investing in property since the property prices can't go down much and always recover.

## Challenge yourself
- 5am. get up challenge.
 - This requires also self-descipline to go to bed early.
- Morning run challenge (July 6 - TBC).
