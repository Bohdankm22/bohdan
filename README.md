- I was always interested about the world of finance. Researching, "playing" on sandbox brokerage accounts etc. However, in the Ukraine investing is not common even between office workers and you don't often here them discussing stock prices of one or another company (exception is only the company they work for or partnered). In Ukraine most of the people see the world of investing as some king of casino where you have to gamble to "win" anything. So with that said people prefer investing in property since the property prices can't go down much and always recover.
- When I got a job after college I started saving some money and looking for ways to invest it. My parents and experience tought me that cash and bank savings accounts are not the best ways to invest since in many cases that don't ever cover the inflation. So, as I was working in the office in Toronto people around were often talking about investments in stocks, ETFs, bonds etc. That was the moment when I realized how I could potentially grow my wealth while keeping my current job and investing part-time into financial education and research (which is also important even if you are not investing).
- TFSA & RRSP. These are two magical financial instruments the goverment of Canada gives its citizens to grow the financial wealth. Here I will compare two of them and describe how to get the most of them.
- First "real" investments. It was late 2018 (I think it was December). I was still learning about different companies, their producs, strategies, CEOs etc., but I already had some money and a lot of ambition to invest (Notice: often happens that my ambition is so big that I rush into doing something without proper learning and preparation. Fortunatelly for me I was lucky to avoid any major issus with this rush, but I realized how sometimes irrational my decisions). So I decided to invest. I did not have right tools (I knew about TFSA & RRSP, but since I have never filled taxes in Canada at that time, I did not have those benefits) and proper knowladge, but I still wanted to invest at least something. And I did.
